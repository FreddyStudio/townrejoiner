# townrejoiner
## About
Rejoins you on ponytown and others after being kicked from the session for AFK.

## How does it work?
It pretty much rejoines ponytown after you get kicked for being AFK too long. I do recommend toggling the Auto Joiner to off if you're editing your OC while not in-game since as soon as you go on pony.town with the auto joiner toggled on it will click the play button instantly.

## How to install?
**Steps:**

1. Enable Developer Mode:
Open your Chromium browser.
Click the three-dot menu (â‹®) in the top-right corner.
Select "Settings" from the menu.
2. Access Extensions:
Scroll down and click on "Advanced" settings.
Under "Advanced," locate the "Extensions" section.
3. Activate Developer Mode:
Toggle the switch next to "Developer mode" to enable it.
Now that Developer Mode is on, you can upload the extension:

4. Go to Extensions:
In the Settings menu, click on the "Extensions" option.
5. Load the Unpacked Extension:
Look for a button labeled "Load unpacked" (it might be hidden under three vertical dots). Click on it.
6. Browse and Select Files:
Navigate to the folder where you have the unpacked extension files.
Select the folder containing the extension's files and click "Open."

That's it! The extension should now be installed <3 let me know if you encounter any bugs.
